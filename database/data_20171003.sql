(4, 'Dear %company_name%:\n\nYour company has collaborated with the anime “Kemono Friends” recently, and that made me feel more interested in your products compared to other companies’. This was a brilliant move that has boosted your international brand fame greatly.\n\nHowever, after acknowledging that Yaoyorozu Co.,Ltd. had resigned from the production of the Kemono Friends Animation due to some disputes, the fanbase, including myself, is deeply unsatisfied with this outcome. The director of Kemono Friends, Mr. Tatsuki is a great director and artist, with his own unique style and talent. It is widely agreed that he and his team is strongly devoted in the creation of this animation. His involvement in the creation of the anime is the sole reason that I’ll continue to support Kemono Friends and its corresponding products. As a loyal audience and customer, I am strongly disappointed with this outcome, in which I believe more efforts could be done to prevent this from happening. Animation, as an artwork, cannot afford to have its creators replaced prematurely. If this decision is finalized, all corresponding enterprises must risk having their customers abandoning their products for good.\n\nIf your business partner, Kadokawa Corporation, fails to make any further efforts to revoke the resignation of Yaoyorozu Co.,Ltd., much of the fanbase, including me, would be forced to reconsider our purchase preferences, including your products, in the near future.\n\nYour product and campaign have been truly amazing. However, Kadokawa Corporation’s failure in their efforts will prevent us from giving our further support to your products.\n\nI really hope that if possible, your company could contact the relevant authorities from Kadokawa Corporation to remedy this situation. We are also expecting to see a public statement made by your company, so as to settle this issue once and for all.\n\nI really wish to continue supporting your products. Thank you, %company_name%.\n\nSincerely yours,\nLoyal customer %user_name%, from %user_nationality%.\n', 'en', True),
(5, 'Dear %company_name%:\r\n\r\nYour recent collaborative advertisement campaign with the “Kemono Friends Project” for your product has received a significant amount of customer interests, and there have been notable inquiries across the Japanese domestic and even overseas markets over this specific product. This is a major advertising coup which has resulted in a significant rise of this product’s exposure.\r\n\r\nI wish to bring to your attention that the resigning of Yaoyorozu Co.,Ltd. from the “Kemono Friends Project” could put this advertisement into jeopardy, given that the animation director from the said company (whom you have worked with personally) has demonstrated his value in conveying your product in a positive light, with this man being one of the main creative driving forces of the “Kemono Friends Project”.\r\n\r\nI, as a customer became interested in your product solely because of the work of this director. I wish to reflect that I am in opposition to this outcome and the failure of Kadokawa in retaining Yaoyorozu Co.,Ltd. from resigning. I believe it will adversely affect your advertisement campaign in the future, both from customer backlash, and in a guaranteed decline over future deliverables due to this change in personnel.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I feel that you would do your business harm if you were to ignore Kadokawa Corporation’s failure and continue to partner with Kemono Friends Project knowing that the charismatic creative force behind the original work is no longer working on this project. \r\n\r\nI strongly suggest your company to correspond with Kadokawa Group with regards to how this change in personnel is likely to impact the corporate image of %company_name%, the marketability of your product and any future products that you wish for Kemono Friends Project to promote, and hopefully see a means for %company_name% to continue building on the success of this advertisement campaign in the future. It is also worth to note that us customers, will be expecting a public statement made by your company so that we can solve this issue for good.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n%user_name% from %user_nationality%.\r\n', 'en', True),
(6, 'Dear Sir/Madam:\n\nAs one of the fans of Kemono Friends, and one of the loyal customers of your product, this letter is used to express our strong desire to have Yaoyorozu Co.,Ltd. and its members involved in the production, including director Tatsuki and his team, the voice actors and other relevant personnels of Kemono Friends Anime Project back to their original post.\n\nYour company held a campaign which collaborated with the animation "Kemono Friends" recently, and that makes us and other fans fond of your product and lead us to follow the company\\''s promotional advertisement. This was a brilliant move which boosted your company\\''s international brand recognition greatly.\n\nHowever, we learnt that Yaoyorozu Co.,Ltd. decided to resign from producing the animation  on 27th of September. We came to acknowledge that this decision was made under disputes, that Kadokawa Corporation has failed to come up with a suitable solution. We, as the series’ fans, felt agitated and found this undesired news regrettable. \n\nThe reason why Director Tatsuki and Yaoyorozu Co.,Ltd are relevant to you is that Yaoyorozu Co.,Ltd is the animation studio that was directly responsible in the making of “Kemono Friends”, and Director Tatsuki is the brainchild behind the animation.  \n\nMr. Tatsuki is a great director, and an artist with a very unique style, which had endeared and amused net-savvy audience abound. His creation is the sole reason that I would support Kemono Friends and its corresponding products, in which includes your product that has advertised with the work. \n\nAs a loyal fan to the anime and customer to your brand\\''s product, we stand strongly against this outcome and would like the company to make genuine effort in amending this dispute. It is self-evident that animation, as an artwork, cannot afford to have its creator easily replaced, at least not prematurely and imprudently. Such use-and-dump act is unwise and it is ungrateful to the hard work put in by the director and the animation studio members, as we believe that Kadokawa could have taken wiser actions.\n\nWe are afraid that if the replacement of staff really takes place, all the related enterprises must bear the risk for the fluctuation of the turnover made by the series. If Kadokawa Corporation, your business partner, will continue to ignore the severity of this outcome and refuse to make further efforts to convince Yaoyorozu Co.,Ltd. from not resigning, us fans may be forced to reconsider our purchase choices, including your products, from future purchases.\n\nYour product and your campaign have been genuinely fantastic, but Kadokawa Group\\''s inaction may prevent other customers from purchasing and consuming any related merchandises. We would like to request to %company_name% to contact Kadokawa Group and express our strong will to reverse this decision, and we would like to see a public statement from your company regarding the aforementioned issue.\n\nWe would like to continue and contribute to the support of your product.\n\nYours sincerely,\n%user_name%, from %user_nationality%.\n', 'en', True),
(7, 'Congratulations on your recent collaboration with the “Kemono Friends Project” for your products. It has received a significant amount of customer interest, both in the Japanese domestic and even overseas markets. Thanks to this collaboration, your products has become something I would regularly support and purchase.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Kadokawa Group was said to be replacing Tatsuki Sensei, the beloved animation director for the “Kemono Friends Project” along with their production company, Yaoyorozu Co.,Ltd., without proper communication. Given the fact that the director (whom your company has worked with directly) has demonstrated his value in conveying your product in a positive light, as well as being the man that is the main creative driving force of the “Kemono Friends Project”, this reckless replacement is nothing but a terrible move to both Kadokawa and %company_name%. I, as a customer, became interested in your product solely because of this collaboration. I wish to reflect that I am in opposition to this decision by Kadokawa corporation, and that I believe it will adversely affect your collaboration campaign in the future, both from customer backlash, as well as a possible decline over future deliverables due to this change in personnel.\r\n\r\nDue to this collaboration, customers like us have come to know of your company and products. Therefore, we as customers will support your products more than we originally would with pleasure. However, now that most fans of the Kemono Friends Project are offended by the disrespectful decision made by the Kadokawa, I would strongly suggest your company to correspond with Kadokawa Group with regards to how this change in personnel is likely to impact the corporate image of %company_name%, the marketability of your products and any future product that you wish for the “Kemono Friends Project” to promote, and hopefully see a means for %company_name% to continue building on the success of this collaboration campaign in the future.\r\n\r\nIn short, I believe that almost every advantage Kadokawa, %company_name% and other companies could gain from the “Kemono Friends Project” has, is, and will be due to the work of Director Tatsuki. Replacing the director would result in massive backlashing from fans that have supported this project. If %company_name% wishes to continue to profit from this campaign, I would recommend your company to contact Kadokawa to have them reconsider this decision to reverse this outcome. I also recommend your company ao announce your regards on this issue with a public statement for all of us to see.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n%user_name%, from %user_nationality%.\r\n', 'en', True),
(8, 'To %company_name%:\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, have come to frequent your establishment after having being exposed to your company through your cross-collaboration with Kemono Friends Project, which as you well understand, is the most visible anime franchise this year.\r\n\r\nWe wish to inform you that Director Tatsuki of the Kemono Friends project A and the latter’s  has been removed from his post by Kadokawa corporation. This is relevant as Director Tatsuki is the heart and soul to the success of Kemono Friends Project, and the man was responsible in the breakthrough success and in the marketing management of the whole project.\r\n\r\nHis departure is likely to negatively impact the nature of your promotional collaboration with Kadokawa through Kemono Project, since the man had garnered significant public goodwill and his sudden firing is treated in negative light by and large, and that losing this Director is likely to lead to a decline in the quality of work that goes into the promotional material and plans that may come after this point.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the original production company of the animation, Yaoyorozu Co.,Ltd. is said to have resigned from the Kemono Friends Project committee, due to some conflicts with Kadokawa Corporation. Yaoyorozu Co.,Ltd. and its production studio happens to be the principal animation firm responsible for all the promotional material up till this point. A change in animation style is unavoidable, which will impact the quality of future promotional work.\r\n\r\nWe ask that you reconsider your ongoing relationship with Kadokawa studios in order to mitigate any negative impact that this firing may have on your business, and we ask that you reflect your viewpoint to Kadokawa, preferably through a public statement, if possible.\r\n \r\nThank you for your understanding.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n%user_name%, from %user_nationality%.\r\n', 'en', True),

Mr. Tatsuki is the core of the series. He saved this IP from a devastating situation (e.g. mobile game being shutdown, manga ended) by creating a unique art style, many charming characters, and a heartwarming story which is loved not just by citizens of Japan, but by audiences all over the world.\n\nFiring him will destroy not only this series, but also your collaboration with this IP.
